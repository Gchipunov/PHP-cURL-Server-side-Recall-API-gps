# PHP-cURL-Server-side-Recall-API-gps
Coding a Google Play Games Services server-side API for PHP MySQL Apache to use for my Android NDK game without Java library doing oauth server to server Google requests 


This is a AI generated and human edited code. no liability lisence, done for fun for my Colo Duo Infermo mental game. 


1. client sends token.

2. server gets token and sends to google server.

3. google API server sends player creditials

4. server gets creditials saves them and uploads to player to view /me

5. server requests recall API snapshots and maybe sorrs or displays to player what one to pick

6. ..., 


my game uses ndk c++ to make pgs calls but some java is unavoidable in android but still can use curl within pgs, some more advanced features would be spawning a background service and using gni and jni etc..

here is the reference doc of whats being done:
